            Yuva STEM is a dynamic initiative founded by alumni of the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Dharwad, driven by a vision to make coding, AI, and digital literacy accessible to every young learner. We believe coding and technology are not just skills — they are the language of tomorrow. In a rapidly changing technological world, Yuva STEM helps students from diverse backgrounds develop curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving abilities that will prepare them for future challenges.

            Yuva STEM's mission aligns with India's National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasizes experiential learning, critical thinking, coding, and digital literacy from an early age. We aim to complement this vision by offering equitable platforms through engaging competitions like the Jr Coder Hunt, free masterclasses, and practical challenges that spark lifelong learning.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm md:text-base mt-4">
            Our commitment is to empower students not only with technical knowledge but also with essential life skills like financial literacy, enabling them to think smart, solve smart, and contribute meaningfully to society. Together, we are building a generation of confident innovators, ready to shape the future of technology.
